# 7-kyu-Friend-or-Foe-
<br><br>
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
<br><br>
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
<br><br>
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
<br><br>
i.e.
<br><br>
friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
<br>
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
